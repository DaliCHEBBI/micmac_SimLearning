\section{Bloc fusion}

Hypothesis :

\begin{itemize}
    \item Two bloc $B_1$ and $B_2$  (the method should work with $N$ blocs),
          each has been oriented and we have an unknown similitude to compute between $B_1$ and $B_2$

    \item $N\geq 2$ triangle between $B_1$ and $B_2$
\end{itemize}

We suppose that the rotation has already been solved, which is "easy" because for each triangle ,
the $2$ edges between the $2$ different bloc give an estimation.  For each triangle we have an estimation
and quality check ($3$ measure of rotation when $1$ is enough). 

We need to estimate the scale $\Lambda$ and translation,
let $P^1$  be a point measured in $B_1$ and $P^2$ the same point in $B_2$, 
we have :

\begin{equation}
	P_2 = \Lambda P_1 + T \label{Eq:Bloc12}
\end{equation}

For each triangle we compute the rotation going to $B_1,B_2$ , and we still
have an unknown scale translation for aligning it on $B_2$,
let $\lambda_i$ and $t_i$  the unknown scale and offset of the triangle .
Names $a,b,c$ the tree point of the triangle,  and $P^a_2, P^b_2 $ their homologues
in  $B_2$ , we have for example:

\begin{equation}
	P^a_2    = a \lambda_i + t_i     \label{Eq:Bloc:Tri2}
\end{equation}

Now we have $2$  possibility for each point , is it belongs to bloc $2$ we know $P^x_2$ the equation
\ref{Eq:Bloc:Tri2} holds and we can use it directly. Else we combine~\ref{Eq:Bloc12} and~\ref{Eq:Bloc:Tri2}
to obtain  :

\begin{equation}
	 \Lambda P^a_1 + T = a \lambda_i + t_i \label{Eq:Bloc:Tri1}
\end{equation}

So finally, for  $n$ triangles we solve a \emph{linear} system with $4*(n+1)$ unkwonw  :
$(\Lambda,T,\lambda_i,t_i)$ and we have $9*n$ equation  (by the way, the system
is unslovable for $n=1$ even if we have $9$ equation for $8$ unknowns, explain why ).

Proposed method :

\begin{itemize}
    \item if there is $2$ triangle use ~\ref{Eq:Bloc:Tri2} and ~\ref{Eq:Bloc:Tri1}
          to estimate $\Lambda,T$;

    \item if there is $N>2$ triangle use some ransac strategy by selecting pair of triangles
          and use previous case to solve it;

     \item if there is $1$ triangle, give up for now;  maybe later, use homologous point between
	     blocs , and outside the triangle to fixe the scale ????

\end{itemize}
